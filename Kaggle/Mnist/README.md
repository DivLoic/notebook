Data
==========
> Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. 
> This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive. The first column, called "label", is the digit.
> Each pixel column in the training set has a name like pixelx, where x is an integer between 0 and 783, inclusive.

`x = i * 28 + j` where:

- i row number
- j column number


label	| pixel1	| pixel2	| ...	| pixel28	
--------|---------------|---------------|-------|---------------
1	| 0-225		|		|	|		
6	| 0-225		|		|	|
9	| 0-225		| 		|	|
