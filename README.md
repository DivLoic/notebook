# Lo√Øc m. Divad notebook

## Jupyter notebook
The IPython Notebook is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. It aims to be an agile tool for both exploratory computation and data analysis, and provides a platform to support reproducible research, since all inputs and outputs may be stored in a one-to-one way in notebook documents.
