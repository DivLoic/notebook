# Lo√Øc m. Divad notebook

## IPython notebook
The IPython Notebook is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media. It aims to be an agile tool for both exploratory computation and data analysis, and provides a platform to support reproducible research, since all inputs and outputs may be stored in a one-to-one way in notebook documents.

## SPARK as a trigger for this.
Since the code can be execute from my personnal laptop or from my server I need to keep up to date my sources code on the both sides. Plus, it's so much easer to commit some files to rum to a server than upload by FTP.
